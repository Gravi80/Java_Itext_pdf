iText has a hierarchical structure.
The smallest text unit is a "Chunk" which is a String with a pre-defined font.
A "Phrase" combines several Chunks and allows to define line spacing.
"Paragraph" is a subclass of "Phrase" and allows to define more layout attributes, e.g. margins.
The class "Anchor" is a subclass of "Paragraph" and serves as the basis for hyperlinks in the generated PDF.
